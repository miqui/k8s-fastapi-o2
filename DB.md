# Database Debug Queries

Sample SQL for poking at the database directly — useful when an API response looks wrong and you
want to check what's actually in Postgres, bypassing the API (and the Hazelcast cache) entirely.
`messagedb` belongs to message-service and lives on the `postgres` StatefulSet
(see [README.md](README.md#architecture)).

## Connecting

Port-forward the cluster's Postgres to your machine first:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/postgres 5433:5432
```

Then, credentials for the bootstrap user (owns `messagedb`, which the postgres image creates from
`POSTGRES_DB` — see `k8s/configmap.yaml`):

```bash
DB_USER=$(kubectl get secret postgres-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.DB_USER}' | base64 -d)
DB_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret postgres-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.DB_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d)
```

**psql**:

```bash
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U "$DB_USER" -d messagedb
```

**DataGrip / other JDBC clients** — point the connection URL at the database:

```
jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/messagedb
```

## message-service (`messagedb`)

Tables: `authors`, `messages` (see `app/models.py` and `migrations/versions/`), plus Alembic's own
`alembic_version`.

### 1. List all authors

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, created_at FROM authors ORDER BY created_at;
```

### 2. List all messages

```sql
SELECT id, title, author_id, version, created_at FROM messages ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 3. Row counts

```sql
SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM authors) AS authors, (SELECT count(*) FROM messages) AS messages;
```

### 4. A message with its author, joined

```sql
SELECT m.id, m.title, m.version, a.name AS author_name, a.email AS author_email
FROM messages m
JOIN authors a ON a.id = m.author_id
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 5. Messages per author (matches `GET /authors/{id}?include=messages`)

```sql
SELECT a.name, count(m.id) AS message_count
FROM authors a
LEFT JOIN messages m ON m.author_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY message_count DESC;
```

### 6. Check a message's current `version` (debugging a `409` from `PATCH /messages/{id}`)

The `409` means the client's `version` no longer matches this row — this is the authoritative value
(`GET /messages/{id}` is served from the Hazelcast cache, see [README.md's Architecture
section](README.md#architecture), so it can briefly lag the row after a burst of writes; see
[Concurrency & Transaction Isolation](README.md#concurrency--transaction-isolation)):

```sql
SELECT id, version, created_at FROM messages WHERE id = '<MESSAGE_ID>';
```

### 7. Find an author with no messages (safe to `DELETE /authors/{id}`)

`DELETE /authors/{id}` answers `409` while messages still reference the author — this finds candidates:

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.name
FROM authors a
LEFT JOIN messages m ON m.author_id = a.id
WHERE m.id IS NULL;
```

### 8. Reproduce the `GET /messages?limit&offset` pagination order

Same `ORDER BY` the API uses (`created_at DESC, id DESC`, served by the `ix_messages_created_at_id`
index) — useful for confirming a page boundary by hand:

```sql
SELECT id, title, created_at
FROM messages
ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

### 9. Duplicate/near-duplicate emails (shouldn't exist — `email` is unique)

```sql
SELECT email, count(*) FROM authors GROUP BY email HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

### 10. Messages created in the last hour, with author

Useful right after running a k6 script or a batch of manual creates:

```sql
SELECT m.id, m.title, a.name, m.created_at
FROM messages m
JOIN authors a ON a.id = m.author_id
WHERE m.created_at > now() - interval '1 hour'
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;
```

### 11. Which migration is applied

```sql
SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;
```

One row, the current Alembic revision (`0001` for the initial schema). No row or an error means
`alembic upgrade head` hasn't run against this database yet.
